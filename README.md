## Time Series Analysis and Forecasting

This project is focused on analyzing and forecasting time series data. The goal is to predict future values based on historical data using various time series models. The project includes steps such as data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and evaluation.

## Project Overview

- **Dataset:** The time series dataset consists of observations recorded at regular time intervals. The specific data and domain (e.g., finance, weather, etc.) should be outlined here.
- **Objective:** The primary objective is to forecast future values using time series modeling techniques.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:**
   - Load the time series dataset.
   - Handle missing data, outliers, and any required transformations (e.g., differencing, scaling).

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualize the time series data to identify trends, seasonality, and noise.
   - Perform statistical analysis to understand the characteristics of the data.

3. **Modeling:**
   - Apply various time series models such as ARIMA, SARIMA, or LSTM (depending on the project's complexity).
   - Train the models on the historical data and fine-tune hyperparameters.

4. **Forecasting:**
   - Forecast future values using the trained model.
   - Visualize the forecast and compare it against actual values (if available).

5. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), or others relevant to the task.
   - Perform cross-validation to ensure the model's robustness.

## Dependencies
